# NeaHack-plugin
This project is a two day challange we decided to make to learn about different technologies. This is our first plugin!
This Chrome extension allows users to preview and process clothing images from websites like Zara using a custom 3D triangulation tool. It provides an overlay where users can paste or enter an image URL, then send it to a local server for processing.

- Python 3.8+
